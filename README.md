==========

Tools to automating access to Tumblr development features, written in Python.

Current features are simple command-line access to download/upload Theme HTML,
and set Custom Theme Variables.

Other "administrative" (as opposed to more 'developer-related') features are
planned as well.  In due time.

I should have the code ready for an initial commit with the week.
