tumblrpype
==========

A Python Page Editor for Tumblr

Primary goal is simple command-line access to download/upload Theme HTML,
and set Custom Theme Variables.

Other "administrative" (as opposed to more 'developer-related') features are
planned as well.  In due time.

So far, the tumblrpype library/package is functional, but I still need to
write the command-line executable app.
